Rational decisions

Rational: maximally achieving pre-defined goals

Rationality only concerns what decisions are made

(not the thought process behind them)

Goals are expressed in terms of the utility of outcomes

Being rational means maximizing your expected utility

"An agent is anything that can be
viewed as perceiving its
environment through sensors
and acting upon that
environment through effectors."

DIRECTED GRAPHS

A graph is also a set of nodes connected by links but where
loops are allowed, and a node can have multiple parents.

We have two kinds of graphs to deal with: directed graphs,
where the links have direction (one-way streets).

INFERENCE ENGINE

The inference engine can be viewed as the processor in an expert
system that matches the facts contained in the working memory
with the domain knowledge contained in the knowledge base, to
draw conclusions about the problem.
